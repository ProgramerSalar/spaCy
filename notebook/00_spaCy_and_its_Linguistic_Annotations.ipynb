    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will start working with spaCy directly. The goals of this chapter are twofold. First, it is my hope that you understand the basic spaCy syntax for creating a Doc container and how to call specific attributes of that container. Second, it is my hope that you leave this chapter with a basic understanding of the vast linguistic annotations available in spaCy. While we will not explore all attributes, we will deal with many of the most important ones, such as lemmas, parts-of-speech, and named entities. By the time you are finished with this chapter, you should have enough of a basic understanding of spaCy to begin applying it to your own texts."

    "And now we see the magical difference. While on the surface it may seem that the Doc container’s length is dependent on the quantity of words, look more closely. You should notice that the open and close parentheses are also considered an item in the container. These are all known as tokens. Tokens are a fundamental building block of spaCy or any NLP framework. They can be words or punctuation marks. **Tokens** are something that has syntactic purpose in a sentence and is self-contained. A good example of this is the contraction “don’t” in English. When tokenized, or the process of converting the text into tokens, we will have two tokens. “do” and “n’t” because the contraction represents two words, “do” and “not”.\n",

For example, if you have a sentence like “The cats are sitting on the mat,” and you process this sentence with spaCy, then sentence1[12].morph would give you the morphological features of the 13th token, if there are that many tokens in the sentence. If the sentence has fewer tokens, trying to access sentence1[12] would result in an IndexError.\n",

    "\n",
    "Aspect=Perf: This indicates the verb is in the perfect aspect, which means the action is completed. The perfect aspect is used to express an action that has been finished at some point in the past, present, or future1. Tense=Past: This denotes that the verb is in the past tense, referring to an action or state that occurred in the past2. VerbForm=Part: This specifies that the verb form is a participle. In English, participles are verb forms used to make perfect tenses or passive voice. They can also be used as adjectives. The past participle is often formed by adding -ed, -d, -t, -en, or -n to the base form of the verb2. So, when you see “Aspect=Perf|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Part,” it describes a past participle form of a verb that is used to construct perfect tenses, indicating a completed action in the past. An example would be the word “written” in the sentence “The book has been written.” 😊"
